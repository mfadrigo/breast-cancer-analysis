## Content

The models, graphs, tables (and the code for them) for the analyses performed can be found:
- [Breast Cancer Analysis](breast_cancer_analysis.ipynb)  


## Data

The data for this investigation came from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository:
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

## Run Models

To run the models, first download the dataset either from the link above or here: [Breast Cancer Data](data.csv)  
Run the "breast-cancer-analysis.ipynb" file and finally you will be asked to locate the data on your local machine prior to building the models.
